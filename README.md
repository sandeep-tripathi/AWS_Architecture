# AWS_Architecture Problem
A solutions architect must design a solution to help manage their customerâ€™s containerized applications. Currently, the customer workload runs in Docker containers on top of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and on-premises servers that run a hybrid Kubernetes cluster. The customer wants to migrate part of their hybrid Kubernetes deployment to the cloud with a minimum amount of effort, and they want to keep all the native features of Kubernetes. The customer also wants to reduce their operational overhead for managing their Kubernetes cluster. Which managed AWS service should the solutions architect suggest to best satisfy these requirements?
